## Laravel Paste Embed

A Wordpress plugin to embed code from paste.laravel.com.  Still in beta - I have not been able to do much testing.


### Installation

This plugin is not yet in the Wordpress Plugin Directory.  Manually add it to your plugins folder and then activate it from within Wordpress.

### Usage
1. Go to paste.laravel.com and create the paste you are going to embed in your page or post.
2. Grab the identifying bit from the end of the URL. 'cJ9' in this case:
    http://paste.laravel.com/cJ9
3. In your page or post add this shortcode, with the relevant part of the URL in question:
    [lpe paste='cJ9']

### Thanks
I have shamelessly stolen the styling from the paste.laravel.com site itself.
