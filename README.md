## Laravel Paste Embed

A Wordpress plugin to embed code from paste.laravel.com.  Still in beta - I have not been able to do much testing.


### Installation

There are two ways to install this plugin: 

1. Search for 'Laravel Paste Embed' in the "Plugins > Add New" menu & go from there. 
2. Download a zip version of this project and install via zip upload or directly install it to your plugins folder via FTP. 

### Usage
1. Go to paste.laravel.com and create the paste you are going to embed in your page or post.
2. Grab the identifying bit from the end of the URL. 'cJ9' in this case:
    http://paste.laravel.com/cJ9
3. In your page or post add this shortcode, with the relevant part of the URL in question:
    ```[lpe paste='cJ9']```


### History

### Thanks
I have shamelessly stolen the styling from the paste.laravel.com site itself. Many thanks to [Dayle Rees](https://twitter.com/daylerees).
