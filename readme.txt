A WordPress plugin for embedding text from paste.laravel.com.

== Description ==

A Wordpress plugin to embed code from paste.laravel.com.  Still in beta - I have not been able to do much testing.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `laravel-paste-embed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to paste.laravel.com and create the paste you are going to embed in your page or post.
4. Grab the identifying bit from the end of the URL. 'cJ9' in this case: http://paste.laravel.com/cJ9
5. In your page or post add this shortcode, with the relevant part of the URL in question: [lpe paste='cJ9']
